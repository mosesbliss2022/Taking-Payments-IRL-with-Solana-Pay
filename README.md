# Taking-Payments-IRL-with-Solana-Pay
This was a smart and dope tutorial from Pointer-gg.

We were able to build the following:
A point-of-sale web app that allows us to take payments from customers in person. We presented QR code that they can scan with a Solana wallet to make the payment.
As soon as they do our app will update to show that theyâ€™ve paid.
We also looksd at online payments in Solana, and built a loyalty card scheme. Did things like give users a 50% discount on every 5th purchase.
